Basic HTML and HTML5: Say Hello to HTML Elements
Welcome to freeCodeCamp's HTML coding challenges. These will walk you through web development step-by-step.

First, you'll start by building a simple web page using HTML. You can edit code in your code editor,
which is embedded into this web page.

Do you see the code in your code editor that says <h1>Hello</h1>? That's an HTML element.

Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.

Opening tags look like this:

<h1>

Closing tags look like this:

</h1>

The only difference between opening and closing tags is the forward slash after the opening bracket of a closing tag.

Each challenge has tests you can run at any time by clicking the "Run tests" button. When you pass all tests,
you'll be prompted to submit your solution and go to the next coding challenge.


To pass the test on this challenge, change your h1 element's text to say "Hello World".
    -->

<!-- answer : -->
<h1>Hello World</h1>


<!-- 2.
Basic HTML and HTML5: Headline with the h2 Element
Over the next few lessons, we'll build an HTML5 cat photo web app piece-by-piece.

The h2 element you will be adding in this step will add a level two heading to the web page.

This element tells the browser about the structure of your website. h1 elements are often used for main headings,
while h2 elements are generally used for subheadings. There are also h3, h4, h5 and h6 elements to indicate different
levels of subheadings.


Add an h2 tag that says "CatPhotoApp" to create a second HTML element below your "Hello World" h1 element.
-->

<!-- answer : -->
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>


<!-- 3.
Basic HTML and HTML5: Inform with the Paragraph Element
p elements are the preferred element for paragraph text on websites. p is short for "paragraph".

You can create a paragraph element like this:

<p>I'm a p tag!</p>


Create a p element below your h2 element, and give it the text "Hello Paragraph".
-->

<!-- answer: -->

<p>Hello Paragraph</p>


<!-- 4.
Basic HTML and HTML5: Fill in the Blank with Placeholder Text
Web developers traditionally use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text. The 'lorem ipsum' text is randomly scraped
from a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.

Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.

Well, 5 centuries is long enough. Since we're building a CatPhotoApp, let's use something called kitty ipsum text.

Replace the text inside your p element with the first few words of this kitty ipsum text: Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet,
shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.
-->

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet</p>

<!-- 5.
Basic HTML and HTML5: Uncomment HTML
Commenting is a way that you can leave comments for other developers within your code without
affecting the resulting output that is displayed to the end user.

Commenting is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely.

Comments in HTML starts with <\!-- and ends with a -->

<!-- without backslash      ^^^^^ -->

<!-- lets make p on number 6 challenge -->
<p> 6.
    Basic HTML and HTML5: Comment out HTML
    Remember that in order to start a comment, you need to use <strong>&lt;!--</strong>  and to end a comment, you need to use
    <strong>--></strong>

    Here you'll need to end the comment before your h2 element begins.
</p>

<!-- answer: -->
    <!--
    <h1>Hello World</h1> -->

    <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

    <!--<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
    -->
