Basic HTML and HTML5: Introduction to HTML5 Elements
HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.

These tags make your HTML easier to read, and also help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.

Note
Many of the new HTML5 tags and their benefits are covered in the Applied Accessibility section.

Create a second p element after the existing p element with the following kitty ipsum text: Purr jump eat the
grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.

Wrap the paragraphs with an opening and closing main tag.

        hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
